== Application Development using MongoDB with PHP

The is some history to be mentioned regarding PHP`'s support for MongoDB.
Since I started using MongoDB with PHP back in 2013, there was the introduction of a new MongoDB driver that was meant to replace the  the older PHP extension http://php.net/manual/en/book.mongo.php[Mongo] which I had been using extensively.
This PHP extension is now deprecated and does not support any version of PHP past version 5.6.
Because the new and improved http://php.net/manual/en/set.mongodb.php[MongoDB driver for PHP] has almost nothing in common with its predecessor, anyone with older PHP code needed to learn a new set of PHP classes and refactor all of their legacy code. The new PHP MongoDB Library is now on https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-php-library[GitHub] and there is https://docs.mongodb.com/php-library/current/[a separate set of official documentation] on the MongoDB site.
There is also a link to the https://derickrethans.nl/new-drivers.html[history] of the legacy drivers/extension and how/why the new drivers/extension evolved to be so different from its predecessor.
