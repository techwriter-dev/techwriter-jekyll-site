<BLOCKQUOTE>
In <A HREF="http://www.softwaremagazine.com/">Software Magazine</A>'s
recent cover story on Linux, Ann Harrison points out how even large 
companies are finding a cost effective alternative to Microsoft in the
deployment of Linux servers:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
"Randy Kessell, manager of technical analysis for a Southwestern Bell 
operation center, notes that
because Linux allows his company to do more remote network 
administration and software loads
than was possible with either Microsoft or NetWare products, it has 
driven down their network management costs."

<P>The September 1998  
<A HREF="http://www.softwaremagazine.com/">Software Magazine</A>
cover story reveals just how far Linux has managed to infiltrate 
coporate America and how it is not about to go away:  

<BLOCKQUOTE>
"Tim Payne, director of
database marketing at Oracle, says many of his company's corporate 
customers have made large
investments in Linux. When Oracle announced in July that it would be 
offering 24x7 support for
Oracle8 on Linux, he says 300 customers called the next day asking 
about availability. 'It's reliable,
it's proven, it runs on commodity Intel boxes, and it's a really 
low-cost alternative to NT,' says
Payne. 'The fact that you are going to be able to get enterprise 
quality support from Oracle to deploy on
the Linux platform will help customers adopt Linux.'

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Ann Harrison's article provides an excellent testimonial from 
Southwestern Bell regarding how Linux outperforms NT:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
"Randy Kessell, manager of technical analysis for a Southwestern Bell 
operation center, . . . 
adds that his company is thinking about replacing 
their NT network server
with Linux. 'Our preliminary tests show that the Linux solution is
outrunning the NT solution,'
says Kessell. 'It's much faster.'

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>For enterprise-level processing power, clustering wth Linux can 
produce awesome results at a modest price.  In a recent report by
Michael Stutz, NASA's Beowulf project sets an example for the  
the potential of such <A HREF="http://www.opensource.org/">Open Source</A>
UNIX operating systems like Linux in the area of supercomputing: 

<BLOCKQUOTE>
"Enter <A HREF="http://www.beowulf.org/">Beowulf</A>, 
a system that uses a parallel-processing
architecture and off-the-shelf machines running the freely
available Linux operating system. One machine is the server
node, and distributes a processing job to all of the other
machines, which are client nodes. 
<P>
"The total hardware cost for CCD's 24-node Beowulf cluster
was US$57,000 -- as compared to most commercial
supercomputers today, which cost between $10 million and
$30 million.  The cluster gives 2.4 gigabytes per second
throughput, which means that a 200 GB hard drive can be
scanned in only 20 seconds. While it took five to seven
weeks to analyze the evidence of several intruders in the
recent Israeli hacker case, Talleur said it would have only
taken a few hours with Beowulf.

<P>"The Beowulf project was developed at NASA by Thomas
Sterling and Donald Becker in the summer of 1994; today,
anyone can buy a Beowulf CD-ROM -- Red Hat
Software's 
<A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/extreme/">Extreme Linux</A>
package -- for $29.

"We have a

James Domengeaux, president of Comspace.Com, a

are rebooted often, he said. "That's a problem especially in

The following "FAT versus NTFS" part of the article has been removed 
because these statements were related more to NT Workstation than 
to NT Server.  Despite the disbelief of some readers, one MIS operations
manager told me that it was their policy (a telecom company providing fiber 
services) to not use NTFS on any of their users' NT Workstations.
As a matter of fact, this manager was <I>extremely</I> adamant about this
topic:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Some MIS departments
are reluctant to implement this file system (at least on users'
machines), because they feel that recovering from disk problems is
hindered by the use of NTFS.  It is a common belief that NTFS formatted
drives cannot be read by DOS, an important OS in the recovery from such
problems.  Rune Knapstad informed me of a DOS utility called 
<A HREF="http://www.sysinternals.com/ntfs20.htm">NTFSDOS</A> 
which can mount NTFS partitions.  It is interesting to note that this
is a third-party product and not a Microsoft one.

Reason: The products aren't similar enough to effectively compare. It's
like comparing apples and oranges. Also, the article is already much too
long to maintain the interest of many managers.

Deleted the following reader feedback from the performance section 
since it has 
come under scrutiny recently.  Casual observations contributed by readers
may be interesting, but it is essential to maintain the integrity of the
article. For the sake of factual comparisons, I
will attempt to include only benchmarks from reputable sources conducted
in a scientific manner concerning future additions to this section of the 
article: 

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I've been running the distributed.net RC5 cracking client for about 2
months now... It's installed on every server that has a significant
amount of idle time. This includes two identical machines: Both are
Dual-Pentium II at 300MHz, 128MB RAM. One is running NT, and has an
idle exchange server (we're planning to offer a service on it, but at
the moment, its <I>totally</I> idle), and the other is running Linux
(we're putting that one through its paces. Its a Samba server, and
we're recompiling all kinds of things on it). The Linux box is trying
keys at 1.8 times the speed of the NT box.

<P><B>One interesting observation:</B>

<P>On May 11, 1998 the <A HREF="http://www.discovery.com/">Discovery
Channel</A> aired a program on the <B>National Security Agency</B> as
part of its "Discovery Signature Series."  Their short description of
this one-hour segment which was broadcast at 9 PM Central Time was
"America's most covert agency uncovers others' secrets with high-tech
wizardry."  The most notable thing about the broadcast was the high
visibility of workstations with the <B><A
HREF="http://www.sun.com/">Sun Microsystems</A></B> logo, not only in
the cryptography classroom, but also in one of their mission control
rooms.	In one area where the NSA manufactures some of its own
microchips, monitors displaying a large "X" were visible, the logo of
the X-Window system used with all UNIX operating systems.  Near the end
of the broadcast, a laptop was seen running a DOS application.	Only
one workstation with the Intel logo was shown during the entire
broadcast.  It was not being used for cryptographic tasks.  It was
doing some facial recognition, but the Window borders of the
application seemed to indicate possibly a non-MS-Windows operating
system.
