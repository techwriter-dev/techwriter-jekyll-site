* As a PHP developer with almost 20 years of experience, my preference for back-end development can be seen in these examples:
 ** *link:2009/11/05/SQL-Query-Examples.html[SQL Queries]*
 ** *link:2012/06/15/Custom-ORM.html[Custom ORM]*
* *link:/2016/09/06/Best-Practices-of-Web-Development.html[Best Practices of Web Development]* -- 34 pages, circa 11,500 words, link:/assets/Best-Practices-of-Web-Development.pdf[PDF] +
This document was inspired by my experience as Perl/PHP developer on a team of web developers at http://mnl.com/about_us/[Media Net Link].
What started out as a training document evolved into a comprehensive set of best practices.
The version presented here has been heavily edited since its debut in 2016, rendering it less specific to any single work environment or industry.
* *link:/nt-vs-unix/en.html[Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 versus UNIX]* -- 40 pages, circa 16,700 words +
Although this self-published white paper from 1998 is not an example of technical documentation, it does showcase my ability to take a technical topic, carry out investigative research, and organize my findings into captivating prose. +
Despite the length of the document, it was extremely popular with IT professionals.
After experiencing the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slashdot_effect[Slashdot effect] it later appeared in print -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AUUG[AUUGN] 19, no. 3 (August 1998), pages 12â€“27 -- and was translated into multiple languages by volunteers:
link:/nt-vs-unix/cn/[Chinese],
Croatian,
link:/nt-vs-unix/cz.html[Czech],
link:/nt-vs-unix/fr.html[French],
link:/nt-vs-unix/de.html[German],
http://www.diff.org/diff/sei/unixVsNT1.shtml[Italian],
link:/nt-vs-unix/id.html[Indonesian],
link:/nt-vs-unix/jp.html[Japanese],
link:/nt-vs-unix/kr.html[Korean],
link:/nt-vs-unix/pt.html[Portuguese],
link:/nt-vs-unix/ru.html[Russian], and
Spanish. +
Its success was driven mainly by fulfilling the need for a systematic comparison and contrast of the prevailing server operating systems at that time, which surprisingly enough, had not been attempted on this level by any tech-savvy journalists.

Wow, thanks! I have been waiting for some objective person to finally
compare these two systems after all of these years. Now I can finally make
an informed decision. Bye bye NT, hello Amiga.

Seriously, what does this have to do with COM?
